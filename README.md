#### The Odin Project Assignment : create tictactoe in Ruby

A version of Tic Tac Toe to be played in the command line. 

The Rspec for this incomplete, I found that the code for this was too procedural and interconnected for this kind of testing and the amount of time I would have to spend to refactor it was not worth it to me at this time.
